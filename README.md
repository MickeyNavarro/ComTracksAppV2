ComTracks - The Android app where you can communicate & keep track of your contacts :)

This is an Android Application made for CST135. The language used is Java. We focused on expanding our knowledge of object oriented programming and Android Studios.

The application is an address book application. You would insert, edit, and delete business and personal contacts. Also, you could search for and attach an image to a contact. Lastly, you could connect to the phones functions of calling, texting, and emailing.
